# Phase 1 — Planning Documentation
## Musanze Potato Market — Order Management System

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Potato farmers and agricultural aggregators in Musanze District, Rwanda, 
currently manage their transactions manually using paper records. 
This leads to frequent errors in order totals, lost receipts, and 
difficulty tracking supplier history.

The Musanze Potato Market Order Management System is a web-based solution 
that allows aggregators to register farmers, create orders, auto-compute 
totals, generate printable receipts, and monitor daily sales through a 
dashboard — replacing paper-based processes with a fast, reliable digital system.
